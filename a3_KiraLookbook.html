    STEP 5: Two secondary content blocks + CTA section 
    ========================================================= -->
       <section>
            <h1>What's trending now?</h1>
            <p>
                When 2020 hit, fashion stopped being about being “in” and became about defining your aesthetic. 
                Suddenly, subcultures and micro-trends were everywhere. The question was no longer “are you in?” 
                but “what’s your aesthetic?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Social media drove this shift, especially with the rise of short-form content. Platforms like TikTok 
                and Instagram transformed how fashion trends were created and consumed. Instead of searching through 
                magazines or blogs, users had a constant stream of videos curated by algorithms, making trends grow 
                exponentially.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="secondary-content">
            <h2>End of the Clean Girl</h2>
            <p>In the early 2020s, the "clean girl" aesthetic took over the internet, with sleek hair and a minimal lifestyle. It promoted not just a fashion style but also a lifestyle. It was no longer about looking like a "clean girl" but being one. 
            Alongside this, fashion shifted toward hyper-feminine looks that reinforced traditional gender roles. Influences like Nora Smith and shows such as The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives gained popularity, turning fashion into a powerful form of cultural messaging and social commentary.
